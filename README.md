# Jepo: Shadow Crown

A Unity game in the Jepo universe.

## You don't know Jepo? 

It's a table top RPG cenario built from scratch by our team . [You can check it here](https://www.jeporpg.com.br/).  
  
Has been our dream for a log time to create a game in Jepo and **Shadow Crown** is a materialization of that dream.

We are developing in our own pace, in free time as a fun hobby so no release date yet.

## About the game
You are **Ed** a gunman hired to guide **Tabata**, a **Tallanor** night god cultist, into the **Ivory Temple**.   
There, the two find the **Crown of the Greater Shadow** and Tabata uses it to unleash Tallanor's shadows across Solaris!

Your mission is to find Tabata and put an end to that chaos.

## Mechanics
- Top down 2D roguelike shooter game;
- Procedural dungeons;
- Difficulty level increases with each dungeon floor;
- Enemies with different classes, with melee and ranged attacks;
- Enemies can drop player-collectable items;
- Projectiles that interact with objects (lighting torches);
- Bullets with different properties (eg flare: deals less damage but illuminates more);
- Ammunition for "special" weapons;
- Few frames of invulnerability when hit by an enemy or trap;
- Shop that allows you to buy skills and consumables;
- Minimap showing previously explored paths apart from the menu, without pausing the game;
- Menu pauses the game;
